      <em>Responsive, Intuitive Interfaces with Ruby</em>
      The next step in the evolution of user interfaces is here. 
      Chatbots let your users interact with your service in their
      own natural language. Use free and open source tools along 
      with Ruby to build creative, useful, and unexpected interactions 
      for users. Take advantage of the Lita frameworkâ€™s step-by-step 
      implementation strategy to simplify bot development and testing.
      From novices to experts, chatbots are an area in which everyone 
      can participate. Exercise your creativity by creating chatbot 
      skills for communicating, information, and fun.
