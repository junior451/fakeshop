# README

This is a shopping app based off of the tutorial from the Agile Web Development Rails 6 book

I'm not strictly following the tutorial as I have introduced new technologies and gems such as the rails annotate gem  and using FactoryBot and rspec instead of Minitest and fixtures. I have also modified the app in parts in order to fit my current understanding of rails as well as just learning about different/new approaches in rails
